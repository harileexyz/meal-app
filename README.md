# Meal Prep Planner

A Flutter starter project for a meal prep planning app that uses Firebase Authentication for email and password sign-in. After a successful login or sign-up, users are redirected to a simple home screen that will later grow into the full meal planning experience.

## Features

- Firebase Authentication with email/password sign-in and registration flows
- Stream-based auth gate that redirects authenticated users to the home screen
- Friendly error messaging and form validation for common auth scenarios
- Placeholder home page with quick sign-out support, ready for future meal planning features

## Getting started

### 1. Install the tooling

Make sure the following tools are installed locally:

- [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (3.16 or newer is recommended)
- Dart SDK (bundled with Flutter)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) and the [FlutterFire CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios#install_the_flutterfire_cli) (`dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`)

### 2. Create a Firebase project

1. Visit the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), create a project, and register the platforms you plan to target (Android, iOS, Web, etc.).
2. Enable **Email/Password** as a sign-in method under **Build → Authentication → Sign-in method**.
3. Download the platform configuration files that Firebase provides:
   - `android/app/google-services.json`
   - `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
   - `macos/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` (if you target macOS)
   - Web configuration is handled through the generated `firebase_options.dart`.

### 3. Generate Firebase options

From the project root run the FlutterFire CLI to generate the correct options file for the platforms you configured:

```bash
flutterfire configure
```

This command overwrites `lib/firebase_options.dart` with the correct values for your Firebase project and updates the platform builds with the necessary Gradle/Xcode configuration. The current file in the repository contains placeholder strings that must be replaced before the app will run.

### 4. Install dependencies

Fetch the project dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 5. Run the application

With Firebase configured and dependencies installed, run the app on your desired device or emulator:

```bash
flutter run
```

Use the email/password form to create a new account or sign in with an existing one. Successful authentication takes the user to the home screen where you can add future meal planning features.

## Project structure

```
lib/
├── app.dart                # Root MaterialApp with theme and navigation setup
├── auth/
│   ├── auth_gate.dart      # Listens to auth state changes and redirects accordingly
│   └── auth_screen.dart    # Email/password login & sign-up form
├── firebase_options.dart   # Placeholder Firebase configuration (replace via FlutterFire CLI)
└── home/
    └── home_page.dart      # Placeholder home view with a sign-out action
```

## Next steps

- Replace the placeholder Firebase configuration with real values generated by the FlutterFire CLI.
- Add form enhancements such as password reset and verification emails.
- Start building the actual meal planning features (recipes, prep schedule, shopping list, etc.).
